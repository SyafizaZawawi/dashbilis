            <h2>My first experience of making an event in kindergarten</h2>
            <p>As a final semester student in Information Management (IM110), I do not deny that it is quite challenging and very tiring especially when having to study online during this pandemic. 
                On January 7, 2022, I organised a storytelling event with five friends at Tadika Rimbun Tunas in Ampang. 
                For your information, it is a final year project (fyp) for the subject of Extension Services for Information Agencies (IMD314) that we need to implement.
                It is the first experience of making an external program as a diploma student.</p>
                
                <p> At first, it was tough for me and the other members of the group to operate the programme 
                    because we were all in different areas and feared that no kindergarten would agree to our programme. 
                    This is because we must deal with children under the age of six, and due to the pandemic, there are strict parents. 
                    Everything went smoothly since Tadika Rimbun Tunas, Ampang, accepted our offer.</p>
                
                <p>Following that, we as a group have done an excellent job of planning, such as making proposals, purchasing tale books and gifts, and practising telling stories. 
                    Furthermore, on the day of the event, my journey to the destination was quite challenging because I had to take public transport, the LRT alone. 
                    Still, everything was simplified and I arrived safely along with five other friends. 
                    Meanwhile, some of my pals use public transportation and others drive their own cars</p>
                
                <p>Furthermore, upon arrival at the destination, the kindergarten's atmosphere was rather vibrant, with children's voices enjoying with their teacher. 
                    Accordingly, we conducted a storytelling program with the children as planned. In my opinion, from the beginning of the program until the end is incredibly exhausting and children are difficult to control. 
                    This is because, they are very active and I understand that minds of children just want entertainment and want to be entertained.</p>  
                
                <p>Among the interesting activities that were successfully carried out with the children at Tadika Rimbun Tunas were aerobics, storytelling, dancing to the rhythm of the song, the "Pukul Berapa Datuk Harimau" game and finally a photo session. 
                    Overall, although it was a bit tiring as all the members were in the early morning and the program ended at 4pm it was well worth it as it provided a very meaningful experience. 
                    The children in the kindergarten were so friendly and fun that some cried when we wanted to go home. 
                    Thank you to Tadika Rimbun Tunas, Ampang for working together to make this storytelling program a success. </p>
